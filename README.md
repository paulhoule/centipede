Command line Java applications without the pain.

Java gets short shrift for writing small command line applications because the
language has a large amount of overhead involved in writing command line applications.

When this overhead is addressed,  Java becomes more competitive with Python and
other languages as a language for data science and batch processing.  The goal of
centipede is to make the creation of command-line applications in Java that support
Maven, Spring, Log4J a single step operation,  and ensuring that simple answers are in
place for the software engineering questions that are often unanswered in data science
projects,  such as providing a place outside version control for private configuration
parameters such as database passwords and API Keys.
